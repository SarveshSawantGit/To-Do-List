# To-Do-List
Human beings have a tendency to forget a lot of things on daily basis, so to keep a track of it some write it on a piece of paper, some writes it in a book and in the modern world where we have smartphones lot of peoples save it on their TODO apps. So to solve this problem, a “TO-DO” Gui has been developed. In this “TO-DO” Gui any individual can list out his/her tasks that he/she wants to perform. It provides the feature of saving and loading his/her data which will help them to continue their tasks in coming future without worrying about loss of any task related data. After completion of the task, the provided data can be deleted also.
